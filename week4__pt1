Comparison of two cities: Houston and Chicago
Yuan Zhang
1.	Introduction
1.1	Background
My husband and I lived in Houston for almost 7 years. My husband has recently got a job offer in Chicago, and we plan to move to Chicago by the end of September. We are familiar with the climate, food, museums, sports and all the fun in Houston, which can be regarded as our second hometown in the world. On the other hand, we have never been to Chicago and the only impression for Chicago is global, multicultural, and cosmopolitan city.
1.2	Problem
My goal is to perform a comparison of the two cities to see how similar or dissimilar they are. Such techniques allow users to identify similar neighborhoods among cities based on amenities or services being offered locally, and thus can help in understanding the local area activities.
1.3	Interest
There will be other job seekers like us would be interested in the difference between two cities, this will help them to make a better decision when they move to a new city. There will be some company would like to expand their business, they would benefit from such analysis. Any people who live in these two cities can also refresh their ideas by checking one city analysis. Such analysis tool is very extensible to other cities comparison, which can give us a basic idea when we want to compare two cities in the world.
